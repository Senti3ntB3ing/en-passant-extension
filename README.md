# en-passant Twitch Extension

This extension is made by Chance LoRicco and communicates with the [en-passant Twitch BOT](https://github.com/Senti3ntB3ing/en-passant-twitch/)\
It uploads the Twitch `Play with Viewers Queue` that is created by the Twitch BOT, and hosts it
as a panel extension.

The En-Passant Twitch BOT was made with ❤️ originally by Cristian A.,\
and is now maintained by thechessnerd team.
